## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Create a functional MVP social network demonstrating core interaction patterns within 2-3 hours development time
• Validate social networking concept with minimal resource investment through deployable demo
• Implement 3-tier functionality: posting system, reaction mechanism, and commenting capability  
• Achieve 30-second user validation flow for immediate concept proof
• Establish scalable component architecture for future development phases
• Meet GitHub repository requirements with comprehensive documentation
• Support both Level 1 (basic functionality) and progressive enhancement through Level 3 (deployment)

### Background Context

Bailanysta addresses the gap between complex existing social networks and the need for focused, authentic social interaction. The current landscape shows users overwhelmed by feature-heavy platforms, creating an opportunity for a streamlined social experience that prioritizes core interactions: sharing thoughts, reacting to content, and engaging through comments. This MVP approach allows rapid validation of innovative concepts like "Ghost Mode Social" (anonymous 24-hour posts) and "Mood-First Posting" (emotion-driven organization) while maintaining technical feasibility within aggressive time constraints.

The project serves dual purposes: immediate concept validation and foundation establishment for scalable social platform development. By focusing on essential interactions and removing authentication complexity, we can demonstrate core value propositions while building reusable component architecture for future enhancement.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, distraction-free social interaction experience that prioritizes authentic expression and meaningful engagement. The interface should feel familiar to social media users while introducing unique concepts like mood-first posting and ghost mode anonymity. Design philosophy emphasizes immediate feedback, clean visual hierarchy, and effortless content creation.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-Click Reactions**: Single tap/click for immediate emotional response without modal dialogs
- **Inline Commenting**: Direct text input beneath posts for seamless conversation flow  
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works immediately, advanced features layer on top
- **Feed-First Navigation**: Primary experience centers on content discovery with profile as secondary view
- **Contextual Actions**: Post management options appear when relevant (own content, edit mode)

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Feed**: Chronological display of all posts with integrated reaction and comment capabilities
- **Profile Page**: Personal post management with creation interface and post history
- **Post Creation Modal/Page**: Focused content creation experience with optional mood selection
- **Theme Settings**: Simple toggle interface for light/dark mode preference

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Implement semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigation support, proper color contrast ratios, and screen reader compatibility for core interactions. Focus on ensuring post creation, reactions, and comments are fully accessible through alternative input methods.

### Branding
Modern, clean aesthetic inspired by contemporary social platforms but with unique visual identity. Color palette should support both light and dark themes while maintaining strong contrast for readability. Typography emphasizes legibility for varied content lengths with special treatment for usernames and timestamps.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on web browsers with responsive design supporting desktop (1200px+), tablet (768-1199px), and mobile (320-767px) viewports. Touch-first interaction design with appropriate tap targets (44px minimum) and swipe-friendly scrolling.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both frontend application and any backend services (if implemented) to simplify development and deployment processes within time constraints.

### Service Architecture
**Frontend-First Monolith**: React-based single-page application with client-side state management and JSON file storage. Optional Express.js backend for Level 2 API integration serving as lightweight REST API for data persistence and external service integration.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing**: Jest for component testing with React Testing Library for integration scenarios. Focus on critical user flows (post creation, reactions, comments) with automated testing for core functionality. Manual testing protocols for user experience validation and 30-second demo flow verification.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

• **Framework Choice**: React 18+ with Vite for rapid development and hot module replacement
• **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and consistent design system implementation  
• **State Management**: React useState/useContext for MVP simplicity, upgradeable to Zustand or Redux if needed
• **Data Persistence**: JSON file storage for Level 1, upgradeable to REST API with Express.js for Level 2
• **Deployment Target**: Vercel preferred for automatic GitHub integration and serverless function support
• **Performance**: Bundle size under 500KB for fast loading on mobile networks
• **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
• **Development Environment**: Node.js 18+ with npm/yarn package management
• **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and error detection
