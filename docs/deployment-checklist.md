- [ ] Critical CSS is inlined
- [ ] Web fonts are optimized

## Deployment Process

### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [ ] Push to `main` branch triggers deployment
- [ ] CI pipeline passes (tests, linting, building)
- [ ] Vercel automatically deploys the application

### 2. Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds: `/api/health`
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Key user flows work (login, post creation, feed loading)
- [ ] Error boundaries display properly for test errors
- [ ] 404 pages render correctly

### 3. Performance Verification
- [ ] Core Web Vitals are within targets:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
  - FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1
- [ ] Page load times are under 3 seconds
- [ ] API response times are under 500ms

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Vercel Analytics is tracking page views
- [ ] Error reporting is working (test with intentional error)
- [ ] Performance monitoring is active
- [ ] Health check endpoint is monitored

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Login/logout functionality works
- [ ] Post creation and editing works
- [ ] Comments and reactions work
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] User profiles load correctly

### SEO and Accessibility
- [ ] robots.txt is accessible at `/robots.txt`
- [ ] sitemap.xml is accessible at `/sitemap.xml`
- [ ] Meta tags are properly set for social sharing
- [ ] Favicon and app icons are loading
- [ ] PWA manifest is accessible

## Rollback Procedures

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. If build fails, check for breaking changes in dependencies
4. Roll back to previous working commit if necessary

### If Application Has Issues
1. Use Vercel dashboard to revert to previous deployment
2. Check error monitoring for specific issues
3. Review database integrity (for JSON storage)
4. Verify third-party service connectivity
