### Insights & Learnings
- **Constraint-driven design leads to clarity**: Time limits force focus on essential features
- **Component reusability is a force multiplier**: One well-designed component serves multiple purposes  
- **User experience validation should happen early**: Role-playing reveals critical interaction patterns
- **Ready-made solutions enable rapid prototyping**: Custom development is the enemy of speed
- **MVP scope definition is critical**: 3 functions vs 6 functions = difference between success and failure

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Implement Core MVP (Posts + Reactions + Comments)
- **Rationale:** Essential functionality that proves concept works
- **Next steps:** Create React app, design Post component, implement JSON storage
- **Resources needed:** 2-3 hours development time, React knowledge
- **Timeline:** Complete within session timeframe

#### #2 Priority: Build Reusable Component Architecture  
- **Rationale:** Maximizes development efficiency and code maintainability
- **Next steps:** Design component props interface, create shared InputForm
- **Resources needed:** React component design experience
- **Timeline:** Integrate during MVP development

#### #3 Priority: Optimize First-User Experience
- **Rationale:** Critical for demonstrating working functionality quickly
- **Next steps:** Add demo posts, ensure instant feedback, test 30-second flow
- **Resources needed:** UX testing, demo content creation
- **Timeline:** Final 30 minutes of development

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Constraint-focused approach kept ideas practical
- SCAMPER method generated concrete implementation ideas
- Role-playing validated user experience assumptions
- Progressive narrowing from 6 functions to 3 core functions

### Areas for Further Exploration  
- **Authentication patterns:** How to add users without breaking simplicity
- **Scaling strategies:** Database migration path from JSON to real DB
- **Performance optimization:** Handling larger datasets efficiently
- **Deployment options:** Quick hosting solutions for demo

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Assumption Reversal:** Challenge the "simple is better" assumption after MVP
- **Time Shifting:** "How would this work with 1000 users?" planning session
- **Morphological Analysis:** Systematic feature combination exploration

### Questions That Emerged
- How to handle user identity without authentication in MVP?
- What's the migration path from JSON storage to real database?
- How to demonstrate social networking with single user?
- What's the deployment strategy for GitHub showcase?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:** Technical implementation planning, deployment strategy
- **Recommended timeframe:** 1 hour technical deep-dive session  
- **Preparation needed:** Environment setup, technology stack research
