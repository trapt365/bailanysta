# Bailanysta PRD Overview

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Create a functional MVP social network demonstrating core interaction patterns within 2-3 hours development time
• Validate social networking concept with minimal resource investment through deployable demo
• Implement 3-tier functionality: posting system, reaction mechanism, and commenting capability  
• Achieve 30-second user validation flow for immediate concept proof
• Establish scalable component architecture for future development phases
• Meet GitHub repository requirements with comprehensive documentation
• Support both Level 1 (basic functionality) and progressive enhancement through Level 3 (deployment)

### Background Context

Bailanysta addresses the gap between complex existing social networks and the need for focused, authentic social interaction. The current landscape shows users overwhelmed by feature-heavy platforms, creating an opportunity for a streamlined social experience that prioritizes core interactions: sharing thoughts, reacting to content, and engaging through comments. This MVP approach allows rapid validation of innovative concepts like "Ghost Mode Social" (anonymous 24-hour posts) and "Mood-First Posting" (emotion-driven organization) while maintaining technical feasibility within aggressive time constraints.

The project serves dual purposes: immediate concept validation and foundation establishment for scalable social platform development. By focusing on essential interactions and removing authentication complexity, we can demonstrate core value propositions while building reusable component architecture for future enhancement.

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **FR1**: Users can create and publish text-based posts to a centralized feed
2. **FR2**: Users can view a chronological feed of all published posts with author and content information
3. **FR3**: Users can react to posts using a single-click heart (❤️) reaction system with visual feedback
4. **FR4**: Users can add text-based comments to any post with immediate display
5. **FR5**: Users can access a profile page showing their created posts and basic information
6. **FR6**: The system implements client-side routing between feed and profile pages
7. **FR7**: Posts display essential metadata: author name, content, timestamp, reaction count
8. **FR8**: The application supports responsive design for web browsers across desktop and mobile
9. **FR9**: All interactions provide immediate visual feedback without page refreshes
10. **FR10**: The system persists data using JSON file storage for demo purposes
11. **FR11**: Users can create and edit their own posts from the profile page
12. **FR12**: The application supports theme switching between light and dark modes with preference persistence
13. **FR13**: Posts support hashtag detection and clickable linking for content organization

### Non Functional

2. **NFR2**: System must use only free/open-source technologies with zero external service costs
3. **NFR3**: Demo must load and function within 30 seconds for user validation
4. **NFR4**: All interactions must respond within 100ms for optimal user experience
5. **NFR5**: Application must be deployable to free hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
6. **NFR6**: Code must be published to public GitHub repository with comprehensive README
7. **NFR7**: Component architecture must be modular and reusable for future development
8. **NFR8**: Application must work without external API dependencies for initial demo
9. **NFR9**: System must gracefully handle edge cases like empty states and long content
10. **NFR10**: All external service calls (if implemented in bonus features) must originate from server-side
