# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Posting System

**Goal**: Establish the foundational project infrastructure while delivering a working post creation and viewing system. This epic creates the technical foundation (React app, component architecture, JSON data handling) and delivers immediate user value through functional posting capabilities. Users will be able to create posts and view them in a feed format, demonstrating core social network functionality.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic UI Framework

As a **developer**,
I want **to initialize the React project with essential tooling and create the basic application shell**,
so that **we have a solid foundation for rapid feature development with modern tooling**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. React 18+ application created using Vite with TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS integrated and configured for rapid styling development
3. Basic application shell with header, main content area, and navigation structure
4. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality and consistency
5. Package.json configured with all necessary dependencies and scripts
6. Basic routing setup with React Router for feed and profile navigation
7. Responsive breakpoint system configured in Tailwind for mobile-first design
8. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore for React/Node applications

### Story 1.2: Post Creation Interface

As a **user**,
I want **to create and publish text-based posts through an intuitive interface**,
so that **I can share my thoughts and start building content for the social network**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Post creation form with text area supporting up to 280 characters
2. Character counter displaying remaining characters with visual indicators
3. "Publish" button that saves post to local JSON storage
4. Form validation preventing empty posts and enforcing character limits
5. Success feedback when post is published successfully
6. Form clears automatically after successful post creation
7. Basic error handling for storage failures with user-friendly messages
8. Post creation interface accessible via dedicated button in main navigation

### Story 1.3: Post Feed Display

As a **user**,
I want **to view all published posts in a chronological feed format**,
so that **I can discover and read content shared by users of the platform**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Main feed displays all posts in reverse chronological order (newest first)
2. Each post shows author name, content text, and formatted timestamp
3. Post cards have consistent styling with proper spacing and typography
4. Feed automatically updates when new posts are created
5. Empty state message displays when no posts exist with call-to-action to create first post
6. Feed supports smooth scrolling for mobile and desktop interactions
7. Post content preserves line breaks and basic text formatting
8. Load time under 500ms for feeds with up to 100 posts

### Story 1.4: JSON Data Persistence

As a **system**,
I want **to reliably store and retrieve post data using JSON file storage**,
so that **user content persists between browser sessions and app reloads**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. JSON storage system handles post creation, retrieval, and updates
2. Data structure supports post ID, author, content, timestamp, and metadata
3. Storage layer gracefully handles browser storage limitations
4. Data validation ensures JSON integrity and prevents corruption
5. Automatic backup of data to prevent loss during development
6. Storage system provides clear error messages for debugging
7. Data migration support for future schema updates
8. Performance optimization for reading large datasets (100+ posts)
