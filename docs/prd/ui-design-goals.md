# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, distraction-free social interaction experience that prioritizes authentic expression and meaningful engagement. The interface should feel familiar to social media users while introducing unique concepts like mood-first posting and ghost mode anonymity. Design philosophy emphasizes immediate feedback, clean visual hierarchy, and effortless content creation.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-Click Reactions**: Single tap/click for immediate emotional response without modal dialogs
- **Inline Commenting**: Direct text input beneath posts for seamless conversation flow  
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works immediately, advanced features layer on top
- **Feed-First Navigation**: Primary experience centers on content discovery with profile as secondary view
- **Contextual Actions**: Post management options appear when relevant (own content, edit mode)

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Feed**: Chronological display of all posts with integrated reaction and comment capabilities
- **Profile Page**: Personal post management with creation interface and post history
- **Post Creation Modal/Page**: Focused content creation experience with optional mood selection
- **Theme Settings**: Simple toggle interface for light/dark mode preference

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Implement semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigation support, proper color contrast ratios, and screen reader compatibility for core interactions. Focus on ensuring post creation, reactions, and comments are fully accessible through alternative input methods.

### Branding
Modern, clean aesthetic inspired by contemporary social platforms but with unique visual identity. Color palette should support both light and dark themes while maintaining strong contrast for readability. Typography emphasizes legibility for varied content lengths with special treatment for usernames and timestamps.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on web browsers with responsive design supporting desktop (1200px+), tablet (768-1199px), and mobile (320-767px) viewports. Touch-first interaction design with appropriate tap targets (44px minimum) and swipe-friendly scrolling.
