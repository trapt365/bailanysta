## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story of the project.

### Technology Stack Information
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ (full-stack React framework for optimal Vercel integration)
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.0+ (type-safe development, prevents runtime errors)
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.0+ (utility-first styling, rapid prototyping)
- **Build Tool**: Next.js 14.0+ (zero-config, optimized for Vercel deployment)
- **Bundler**: Turbopack (Next.js) - 10x faster than Webpack, built into Next.js 14

**Deviation Note**: Epic specifies "React 18+ with Vite" but architecture uses Next.js 14+. Following architecture specification for full-stack capability.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Good foundation with clean component architecture and proper TypeScript usage. Implementation follows React best practices with functional components and proper separation of concerns. However, critical gaps exist in testing coverage and some deviations from architectural specifications.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: src/components/ui/icons.tsx
- **Change**: Extracted inline SVG icons into reusable icon components
- **Why**: Eliminates code duplication and improves maintainability
- **How**: Created typed icon components with consistent props interface

**File**: src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx  
- **Change**: Refactored to use extracted icon components
- **Why**: Removes 50+ lines of inline SVG definitions
- **How**: Imported icon components and updated IconComponent mapping logic

**File**: src/components/layout/Header.tsx
- **Change**: Updated to use extracted icons and improved accessibility
- **Why**: Consistency with Navigation component and better UX
- **How**: Added proper ARIA labels and focus management for icon buttons

**File**: src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx
- **Change**: Added React error boundary component
- **Why**: Required by coding standards for proper error handling
- **How**: Class component with error state management and user-friendly fallback UI

**File**: src/app/layout.tsx
- **Change**: Integrated ErrorBoundary wrapper around Layout
- **Why**: Provides application-wide error handling
- **How**: Wrapped Layout component with ErrorBoundary for graceful error recovery

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ **Issues Found**
  - Using Next.js App Router (`src/app/`) instead of specified Pages Router (`src/pages/`)
  - Missing config abstraction for environment variables
  - Direct Tailwind usage instead of abstracted design tokens
- Project Structure: ✗ **Deviation from Source Tree**
  - App structure differs from specified pages-based architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **No Tests**
  - Zero test coverage across all acceptance criteria
  - No component rendering tests, navigation tests, or integration tests
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ **Partial with Deviation**
  - AC1: Used Next.js instead of specified Vite + React
  - AC2-8: Functionally implemented but untested

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed by QA:**
- [x] Extracted icon components for better maintainability (src/components/ui/icons.tsx)
- [x] Added ErrorBoundary for application-wide error handling (src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx)
- [x] Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus management
- [x] Eliminated SVG code duplication in Navigation component

**Requires Dev Action:**
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite covering all 8 acceptance criteria
- [ ] Implement component unit tests (Layout, Header, Navigation, ErrorBoundary)
- [ ] Add integration tests for navigation flow and routing
- [ ] Create responsive design validation tests
- [ ] Set up linting pipeline - ESLint/Prettier currently non-functional
- [ ] Consider migrating to Pages Router to match architectural specification
- [ ] Abstract environment variable access through config utility
- [ ] Implement design token system for consistent styling

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** - No security vulnerabilities identified in current implementation. Code follows React security best practices with proper component isolation and no direct DOM manipulation.

### Performance Considerations

**Status: GOOD** - Bundle size within targets, proper code splitting via Next.js, optimized font loading. No performance bottlenecks identified in current implementation.

### Files Modified During Review

- `src/components/ui/icons.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx` (refactored)
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (improved accessibility)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (added error boundary)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-basic-ui-framework.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/1.1-risk-20250831.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/1.1-nfr-20250831.md

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Critical testing gap must be addressed before marking as Done. While implementation is functionally complete and code quality is good, the complete absence of tests for a foundational story creates significant risk for future development.
