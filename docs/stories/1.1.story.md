# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic UI Framework

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to initialize the React project with essential tooling and create the basic application shell,  
**so that** we have a solid foundation for rapid feature development with modern tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React 18+ application created using Vite with TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS integrated and configured for rapid styling development
3. Basic application shell with header, main content area, and navigation structure
4. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality and consistency
5. Package.json configured with all necessary dependencies and scripts
6. Basic routing setup with React Router for feed and profile navigation
7. Responsive breakpoint system configured in Tailwind for mobile-first design
8. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore for React/Node applications

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story of the project.

### Technology Stack Information
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ (full-stack React framework for optimal Vercel integration)
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.0+ (type-safe development, prevents runtime errors)
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.0+ (utility-first styling, rapid prototyping)
- **Build Tool**: Next.js 14.0+ (zero-config, optimized for Vercel deployment)
- **Bundler**: Turbopack (Next.js) - 10x faster than Webpack, built into Next.js 14

**Deviation Note**: Epic specifies "React 18+ with Vite" but architecture uses Next.js 14+. Following architecture specification for full-stack capability.

- **ESLint Configuration**: Next.js standard rules with TypeScript support
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting across project
- **File Organization**: Components in `src/components/`, pages in `src/pages/`

### Testing
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Testing Framework**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs for initial setup
- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory structure mentioned in source tree
- **Future Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library specified in tech stack for components

### Technical Constraints
