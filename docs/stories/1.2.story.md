# Story 1.2: Testing Foundation & Code Quality

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** comprehensive testing infrastructure and code quality tooling for the React application,  
**so that** we have reliable test coverage and consistent code standards for ongoing development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Comprehensive test suite covering all 8 acceptance criteria from Story 1.1
2. Component unit tests for Layout, Header, Navigation, and ErrorBoundary components  
3. Integration tests for navigation flow and routing functionality
4. Responsive design validation tests for mobile-first approach
5. ESLint/Prettier pipeline fixed and functional for code quality enforcement
6. Test framework configured (Vitest + Testing Library as per tech stack)
7. Test scripts added to package.json with proper development workflow
8. CI/CD pipeline foundation for automated testing (if applicable)

## Dev Notes

### Background Context
This story addresses critical testing gaps identified in Story 1.1 QA review:
- Zero test coverage across all acceptance criteria (high risk)
- ESLint/Prettier pipeline non-functional (medium risk)
- Need for comprehensive testing foundation before additional features

### Quality Gate Requirements
From Story 1.1 assessment (docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-basic-ui-framework.yml):
- **Issue**: Zero test coverage creates risk for future development
- **Severity**: Medium (but blocks story completion)
- **Category**: test-coverage
- **Owner**: dev

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest (fast, Vite-native testing)
- **Component Testing**: Testing Library/React (behavior-focused testing)
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, Integration tests, E2E tests (Playwright for later stories)

### Test Architecture Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component behavior and rendering
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and data flow
- **Responsive Tests**: Viewport-based behavior validation
- **Accessibility Tests**: ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation

### Success Criteria
- Story 1.1 can move from CONCERNS to PASS gate status
- Quality score improvement from 70/100 to 85+/100
- All acceptance criteria from Story 1.1 have corresponding test coverage
- Development pipeline includes automated quality checks
