## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From previous stories, the following project structure and patterns have been established:
- Complete Next.js application with tRPC API layer using TypeScript
- Comprehensive testing setup with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Production-ready deployment configuration for Vercel
- Well-organized component architecture with UI, forms, feed, user, and layout sections
- Established data storage and business logic patterns through services and routers

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
The project uses a modern, production-ready tech stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes with tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, tRPC for server state
- **Database**: JSON files (development) → Vercel KV (production)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics and logging

Each technology choice has specific rationale documented for development speed, type safety, and production scalability.

### Project Structure Context  
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The project follows a well-organized structure:
- `src/components/` - Organized by feature (ui, forms, feed, user, layout)
- `src/pages/` - Next.js file-based routing with API routes
- `src/server/` - Backend logic (routers, services, middleware, utils)
- `src/types/` - Shared TypeScript definitions
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test coverage matching source structure
- `docs/` - Architecture and PRD documentation
- Development workflow includes clear setup, testing, and deployment processes

### Documentation Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Documentation must meet professional GitHub standards:
- Clear project description with value proposition
- Complete installation instructions with prerequisites
- Development workflow and contribution guidelines
- Technical decisions with rationale and trade-offs
- Known limitations with honest assessment of MVP constraints
- Professional presentation with badges, screenshots, and examples

### File Locations
- **Main README**: `README.md` (project root)
- **API Documentation**: Include in README or separate `docs/api.md`
- **Contributing Guidelines**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` or README section
- **Screenshots/Assets**: `public/images/` or `docs/images/`
- **Documentation Support**: Update existing `docs/` structure if needed

### Technical Implementation Requirements
- Documentation should be written in clear, professional English
- Include actual code examples and screenshots where helpful
- Use proper Markdown formatting with tables, lists, and code blocks
- Add relevant badges for deployment status, build status, and tech stack
- Ensure all links work and point to correct resources
- Include proper attribution for any external resources or inspirations

### Performance and Quality Standards
- README should load quickly and be scannable for quick understanding
- Include table of contents for long sections
- Use consistent formatting and professional presentation
- Ensure all code examples are tested and accurate
- Make documentation accessible to developers of varying experience levels

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Verify all code examples and setup instructions work correctly
- **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal and external links function properly
- **Setup Verification**: Test installation instructions on clean environment
- **Completeness Review**: Validate all acceptance criteria are addressed

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Installation Process**: Following setup instructions successfully installs and runs project
2. **Development Workflow**: Documentation enables new developer to contribute effectively
3. **API Examples**: All documented API examples work as described
4. **Technical Accuracy**: All technical details and rationale are correct and current
5. **Professional Presentation**: Documentation meets GitHub professional standards
6. **Accessibility**: Documentation is clear for developers at different experience levels
7. **Completeness**: All required sections present and comprehensive
8. **Currency**: All version numbers, links, and technical details are up to date

### Success Criteria
- README serves as complete getting-started guide for new developers
- Technical stack documentation enables informed technology decisions
- Project demonstrates professional development practices through documentation
- All setup instructions verified through clean environment testing
- Documentation supports project's demo and portfolio presentation goals
