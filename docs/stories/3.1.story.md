# Story 3.1: Dark/Light Theme System

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to switch between dark and light themes with my preference saved,
**so that** I can customize the visual experience to match my environment and personal preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Theme toggle button in main navigation with sun/moon icon indicators
2. Complete dark theme covering all components: posts, comments, forms, navigation
3. Light theme as default with proper contrast ratios for accessibility
4. Theme preference persists in localStorage across browser sessions
5. Smooth CSS transitions between themes without jarring color shifts
6. System respects user's OS theme preference on first visit
7. All interactive elements maintain proper contrast in both themes
8. Theme state integrates with existing component architecture

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 (Enhanced Post Management), the following components and patterns are established:
- Complete component architecture in place: PostCard, Navigation, UserProfile, forms
- Tailwind CSS utility classes used throughout for styling
- Zustand store pattern established for state management (uiStore exists)
- Component design patterns with consistent styling approaches
- Comprehensive testing setup with component and integration tests

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
The project uses a modern styling and state management stack:
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.0+ for utility-first styling with dark mode support
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.0+ for lightweight state management
- **Icons**: Heroicons React library for consistent iconography (sun/moon icons available)
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing
- **Browser APIs**: localStorage for preference persistence, matchMedia for system theme detection

### Component Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md + components.md]
```typescript
// Theme-related interfaces to implement
interface UIState {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  setTheme: (theme: UIState['theme']) => void;
  // existing UI state properties...
}

interface ThemeToggleProps {
  className?: string;
}

// Hook interface for theme management
interface UseThemeReturn {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  resolvedTheme: 'light' | 'dark'; // computed theme after system detection
  setTheme: (theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system') => void;
  toggleTheme: () => void;
}
```

### Project Structure Context
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Theme Hook**: `src/hooks/useTheme.ts` (new file)
- **Enhanced UI Store**: `src/stores/uiStore.ts` (existing, needs theme state)
- **Theme Toggle Component**: `src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx` (new component)
- **Enhanced Navigation**: `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx` (existing, needs toggle)
- **Global Styles**: `src/styles/globals.css` (existing, needs dark theme variables)
- **Test Files**: `tests/hooks/useTheme.test.ts`, `tests/components/ui/ThemeToggle.test.tsx`

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
// User preferences should be enhanced to include theme
interface UserPreferences {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  language: 'en' | 'ru';
}

// User model already includes preferences field
interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}
```

### Technical Implementation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate Zustand state directly - use store actions for theme changes
- **CSS Classes**: Use Tailwind's dark: prefix for dark theme variants
- **Browser APIs**: Use `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` for system theme detection
- **Persistence**: Store theme preference in localStorage with key 'theme-preference'
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Performance**: Use CSS custom properties for theme colors to minimize bundle size

### Theme Implementation Strategy
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **CSS Variables**: Define theme colors as CSS custom properties in :root and .dark
- **Tailwind Configuration**: Use Tailwind's built-in dark mode with 'class' strategy
- **Component Updates**: Apply `dark:` prefixed classes to all existing components
- **System Integration**: Detect user's OS preference and apply automatically on first visit
- **Smooth Transitions**: Add transition properties to color-changing elements

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md + tech-stack.md]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for hook testing, React Testing Library for component testing
- **Hook Tests**: `tests/hooks/useTheme.test.ts` for theme state management and persistence
- **Component Tests**: `tests/components/ui/ThemeToggle.test.tsx` for toggle behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Theme persistence across browser sessions and component updates
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated contrast ratio testing for both theme variants

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Hook Testing**: useTheme hook state management, localStorage persistence, system theme detection
- **Component Testing**: ThemeToggle button behavior, icon changes, accessibility labels
- **Integration Testing**: Theme changes propagate across all components, persistence works correctly
- **Accessibility Testing**: Contrast ratios meet WCAG standards in both light and dark themes

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Theme Toggle**: User can click toggle to switch between light and dark themes
2. **Persistence**: Theme preference saves to localStorage and persists across browser sessions
3. **System Detection**: App detects and respects user's OS theme preference on first visit
4. **Visual Consistency**: All components display correctly in both light and dark themes
5. **Smooth Transitions**: Theme changes animate smoothly without jarring color shifts
6. **Accessibility**: All interactive elements maintain proper contrast in both themes
7. **Component Integration**: Theme state integrates properly with existing Zustand store
8. **Performance**: Theme switching doesn't cause layout shifts or performance issues

### Success Criteria
- All 8 acceptance criteria validated through automated tests
- Theme switching completes within 200ms with smooth transitions
- WCAG contrast ratio compliance verified for both themes
- Theme preference persistence works reliably across browser sessions
- No visual glitches or layout shifts during theme transitions
