[Source: architecture/source-tree.md + tech-stack.md]
```typescript
// Next.js production build configuration
interface NextConfig {
  experimental: {
    turbo: boolean;           // Enable Turbopack for faster builds
  };
  compress: boolean;          // Enable gzip compression
  poweredByHeader: boolean;   // Remove X-Powered-By header for security
  generateEtags: boolean;     // Enable ETags for caching
  images: {
    domains: string[];        // Configure image optimization domains
    formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif']; // Modern image formats
  };
  headers: () => Promise<Array<{
    source: string;
    headers: Array<{ key: string; value: string }>;
  }>>;                       // Security and caching headers
}

// Package.json scripts for deployment
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build --turbopack",          // Production build
    "start": "next start",                      // Production server
    "analyze": "ANALYZE=true npm run build"     // Bundle analysis
  }
}
```

### Vercel Configuration Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```json
// vercel.json deployment configuration
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["cle1"],
  "functions": {
    "src/pages/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options", 
          "value": "DENY"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance and Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
// Performance optimization targets
interface PerformanceTargets {
  bundleSize: {
    initial: '<500KB';         // AC requirement
    perRoute: '<200KB';        // Route-based splitting
  };
  caching: {
    staticAssets: 'browser cache';
    apiResponses: 'SWR pattern';
    edgeCaching: 'CDN for global distribution';
  };
  loadingStrategy: {
    codeSplitting: 'per route';
    lazyLoading: 'for modals';
    preloading: 'for likely navigation';
  };
}

// Security headers configuration
const securityHeaders = {
  csp: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://api.vercel.com;`,
  xssProtection: 'Content sanitization using DOMPurify, CSP headers',
  tokenStorage: 'JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies (production), localStorage with expiration (development)',
  cors: `{ origin: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, credentials: true, methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'] }`
};
```

### Environment Variable Management
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md + backend-architecture.md]
```typescript
// Production environment variables setup
interface ProductionEnvVars {
  // Public variables (prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_)
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME: string;
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL: string;       // Production URL
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: string;       // API base URL  
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT: 'production';
  
  // Private server variables
  JWT_SECRET: string;                // Strong production secret
  SESSION_SECRET: string;            // Session encryption
  NODE_ENV: 'production';
  
  // Future Vercel integrations
  VERCEL_KV_REST_API_URL?: string;
  VERCEL_KV_REST_API_TOKEN?: string;
  VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN?: string;
}
```

### Data Storage and Migration Context
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
The current MVP uses JSON file storage that needs production consideration:
```typescript
// Storage layer abstraction allows future migration
class JSONStorage {
  private dataPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data');
  // Current: JSON files for MVP
  // Future: Easy migration to Vercel KV Redis
  
  // Production considerations:
  // - JSON files work on Vercel with persistent storage
  // - Data directory needs to be created in production
  // - File operations are atomic and safe for concurrent access
}
```

### Monitoring and Error Handling
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
// Production monitoring setup
interface MonitoringConfig {
  frontend: {
    analytics: 'Vercel Analytics + Web Vitals tracking';
    errorTracking: 'Console logging with future Sentry integration';
    performance: 'Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)';
    userInteractions: 'Post creation, reactions, comments tracking';
  };
  backend: {
    performance: 'Vercel Functions Analytics';
    errorRates: 'Request rate per endpoint and user';
    responseTime: 'Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)';
    logging: 'Vercel Logs for server-side logging';
  };
}

// Error handling requirements
const errorHandling = {
  apiErrorFormat: 'Standard TRPCError format for all API routes',
  frontendErrors: 'Global error boundary pattern',
  logging: 'Console logging (development) with future Sentry (production)',
  userFeedback: 'User-friendly error messages with retry options'
};
```

### Testing and Verification Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md + source-tree.md]
```typescript
// Deployment verification requirements
interface DeploymentTesting {
  buildTests: {
    framework: 'GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline';
    buildVerification: 'npm run build succeeds';
    bundleSize: 'Bundle analysis to verify <500KB target';
    typeChecking: 'TypeScript compilation without errors';
  };
  
  smokeTests: {
    healthCheck: '/api/health endpoint responds correctly';
    authentication: 'Login/logout flow works in production';
    coreFeatures: 'Post creation, feed loading, reactions work';
    errorHandling: 'Error boundaries and 404 pages render correctly';
  };
  
  performanceTests: {
    webVitals: 'Core Web Vitals meet targets';
    loadTimes: 'Page load times under performance budgets';
    apiResponse: 'API response times under 500ms target';
  };
}

```

### Deployment Workflow Context
The deployment process follows GitHub Actions integration with Vercel:
1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes to main branch
2. **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions runs tests, linting, type checking
3. **Build Verification**: Automated build process with bundle size checks
4. **Vercel Deploy**: Automatic deployment to production environment
5. **Health Checks**: Automated verification of deployed application
6. **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics tracks performance and errors post-deployment

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Build Testing**: Verify Next.js production build completes successfully with optimizations
- **Bundle Analysis**: Ensure production bundle meets <500KB requirement from AC
- **Environment Testing**: Validate environment variable configuration in different environments
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Test CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Vercel integration
- **Smoke Testing**: Production deployment verification through automated health checks
- **Performance Testing**: Validate Web Vitals and loading performance in production
- **Security Testing**: Verify security headers and error handling in production environment

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Production Build**: Next.js build completes with Turbopack optimizations and bundle under 500KB
2. **Vercel Deployment**: Automatic deployment from GitHub triggers correctly with proper configuration
3. **Environment Variables**: Production and development environments use correct variable sets
4. **Asset Optimization**: Images and static assets load with proper compression and caching
5. **Error Handling**: Production error boundaries display user-friendly messages
6. **Health Checks**: `/api/health` endpoint responds correctly in production
7. **Performance**: Core Web Vitals meet targets and loading times are optimized
8. **Security**: Security headers are properly configured and authentication works

### Success Criteria
- All 8 acceptance criteria validated through automated and manual testing
- Production build completes under 500KB bundle size requirement
- Vercel deployment pipeline successfully deploys from GitHub without errors
- Environment variables properly configured for production/development differences
- Static assets optimized with proper caching and compression headers
- Production error handling provides appropriate user feedback
- Deployment verification checklist passes all health checks
- README documentation includes complete deployment instructions
