# Story 1.4: JSON Data Persistence

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to reliably store and retrieve post data using JSON file storage,
**so that** user content persists between browser sessions and app reloads.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. JSON storage system handles post creation, retrieval, and updates
2. Data structure supports post ID, author, content, timestamp, and metadata
3. Storage layer gracefully handles browser storage limitations
4. Data validation ensures JSON integrity and prevents corruption
5. Automatic backup of data to prevent loss during development
6. Storage system provides clear error messages for debugging
7. Data migration support for future schema updates
8. Performance optimization for reading large datasets (100+ posts)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3, we learned that the Post interface includes mood, hashtags, and reaction counts. The storage system must support these denormalized fields for performance optimization.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface Post {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  content: string;               // max 280 characters
  authorId: string;              // user reference
  authorName: string;            // denormalized for performance
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  mood?: 'Happy' | 'Thoughtful' | 'Excited' | 'Contemplative' | 'Energetic';
  hashtags: string[];            // extracted from content
  reactionCount: number;         // denormalized counter
  commentCount: number;          // denormalized counter
}
```

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Storage Layer**: `src/server/utils/storage.ts` (abstract storage operations)
- **Data File**: `data/bailanysta.json` (JSON storage file)
- **Validation Schemas**: `src/utils/validation.ts` (Zod schemas)
- **Type Definitions**: `src/types/shared.ts` (shared Post interface)
- **Services**: `src/server/services/postService.ts` (business logic using storage)
- **Test Files**: `tests/server/utils/storage.test.ts` and `tests/server/services/`

### Technical Implementation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Storage Operations**: Abstract all operations through storage layer - never access JSON files directly from services
- **Data Validation**: All user inputs must be validated with Zod schemas defined in `src/utils/validation.ts`
- **Error Handling**: All API routes must use the standard TRPCError format
- **Type Sharing**: Define shared types in `src/types/shared.ts` - never duplicate interfaces

### Data Structure Design
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The `data/bailanysta.json` file should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "users": {},
  "posts": {},
  "comments": {},
  "reactions": {}
}
```

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Response Time Target**: <100ms for cached data, <500ms for database queries
- **Database Optimization**: Denormalized counters, indexed queries
- **Caching Strategy**: Vercel KV for API responses (future), in-memory caching for development

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
export const ERROR_CODES = {
  DATABASE_ERROR: 'DATABASE_ERROR',
  VALIDATION_FAILED: 'VALIDATION_FAILED',
  NOT_FOUND: 'NOT_FOUND',
  INTERNAL_ERROR: 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
} as const;
```

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for server-side testing
- **Test Location**: `tests/server/utils/storage.test.ts`
- **Test Coverage**: CRUD operations, error scenarios, performance benchmarks
- **Integration**: Full storage workflow testing with validation

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Test all storage operations (create, read, update, delete)
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete data persistence workflows
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Corrupted JSON, file system errors, validation failures
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark with 100+ posts to meet AC requirements

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Storage CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete posts with validation
2. **Error Handling**: File system failures, JSON corruption, schema validation errors
3. **Data Integrity**: Atomic writes, backup/restore functionality
4. **Performance**: Large dataset operations under 500ms target
5. **Migration Testing**: Schema version upgrades and data migration

### Success Criteria
- All 8 acceptance criteria validated through automated tests
- Storage operations maintain data integrity under concurrent access
- Error scenarios gracefully handled with appropriate user feedback
- Performance benchmarks meet <500ms response time requirements
