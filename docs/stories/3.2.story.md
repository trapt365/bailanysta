# Story 3.2: Loading States & Animations

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Status

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see smooth loading indicators and micro-animations during interactions,
**so that** the application feels responsive and professional during data operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Loading spinners appear during post creation and data fetching operations
2. Skeleton screens display while feed content loads
3. Micro-animations for button clicks, form submissions, and state changes
4. Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
5. Error states with retry options for failed operations
6. Loading indicators follow consistent design system across components
7. Performance optimized animations that don't impact app responsiveness

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 (Dark/Light Theme System), the following components and patterns are established:
- Complete theme system with smooth transitions already implemented
- Tailwind CSS utility classes used throughout with dark mode support
- Zustand store pattern established for UI state management
- Comprehensive testing setup with component and integration tests
- ThemeToggle component demonstrates smooth animation patterns to follow

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
The project uses modern frontend animation and loading libraries:
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.0+ with built-in animation utilities and transition classes
- **Component Library**: Headless UI for accessible loading indicators and focus management
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.0+ for loading state management across components
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ with React 18 Suspense for loading boundaries
- **Icons**: Heroicons React library for spinner and loading icons
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for animation and loading state testing

### Component Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md + components.md]
```typescript
// Loading state interfaces to implement
interface LoadingState {
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  retry: () => void;
}

interface SpinnerProps {
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  color?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'current';
  className?: string;
  'aria-label'?: string;
}

interface LoadingButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  isLoading: boolean;
  loadingText?: string;
  spinner?: React.ReactNode;
}

// Skeleton component interfaces
interface SkeletonProps {
  className?: string;
  animate?: boolean;
  count?: number;
}

interface PostCardSkeletonProps {
  showAvatar?: boolean;
  showActions?: boolean;
}
```

### Project Structure Context
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Loading Components**: `src/components/ui/Spinner.tsx`, `src/components/ui/LoadingButton.tsx`, `src/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` (new files)
- **Skeleton Components**: `src/components/ui/PostCardSkeleton.tsx`, `src/components/ui/NavigationSkeleton.tsx` (new components)
- **Enhanced UI Store**: `src/stores/uiStore.ts` (existing, needs loading state management)
- **Error Handling**: `src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `src/components/ui/ErrorToast.tsx` (new components)
- **Animation Utilities**: `src/utils/animations.ts` (new utility file for animation helpers)
- **Test Files**: `tests/components/ui/loading.test.tsx`, `tests/components/ui/animations.test.tsx`

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
// Loading state should be added to UI store
interface UIState {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  loadingStates: Record<string, boolean>; // Track loading for different operations
  errors: Record<string, string | null>; // Track errors for different operations
  setLoading: (key: string, isLoading: boolean) => void;
  setError: (key: string, error: string | null) => void;
  // existing UI state properties...
}

// Enhanced tRPC hook return types with loading states
interface PostMutation {
  mutate: (data: CreatePostInput) => void;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: TRPCError | null;
  isError: boolean;
  reset: () => void;
}
```

### Technical Implementation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Animation Performance**: Use CSS transforms and opacity for smooth 60fps animations
- **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA labels, respect prefers-reduced-motion media query
- **Loading States**: Show loading indicators for operations taking longer than 200ms
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages with retry options for failed operations
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure loading states work correctly across all device sizes
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize animation CSS to minimize impact on bundle size

### Animation Implementation Strategy
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **CSS Transitions**: Use Tailwind's transition utilities for hover and focus states
- **Keyframe Animations**: Implement spinner and skeleton animations using CSS keyframes
- **React Transitions**: Use React state for managing loading transitions between components
- **Performance**: Leverage `will-change` CSS property and GPU acceleration for smooth animations
- **Reduced Motion**: Implement `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` for accessibility

### Loading State Management
- **Global Loading**: Manage app-wide loading states through UI store
- **Component Loading**: Local loading states for individual operations
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback before API confirmation
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error states and retry mechanisms for failed operations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation when JavaScript is disabled

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md + tech-stack.md]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for component testing, React Testing Library for loading state testing
- **Animation Testing**: `tests/components/ui/loading.test.tsx` for loading component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Loading states during actual data operations and API calls
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation during loading
- **Performance Tests**: Animation performance testing and reduced motion compliance

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Component Testing**: All loading components (Spinner, LoadingButton, Skeleton) behavior and props
- **Loading State Testing**: Integration with tRPC mutations and queries for proper loading indicators
- **Animation Testing**: CSS transitions and keyframe animations work correctly across browsers
- **Error State Testing**: Error boundaries, toast notifications, and retry functionality
- **Accessibility Testing**: ARIA labels, reduced motion support, keyboard navigation

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Spinner Component**: Different sizes, colors, and accessibility labels render correctly
2. **Loading Button**: Shows spinner during async operations, disables interaction
3. **Skeleton Loading**: Displays while data loads, transitions smoothly to actual content
4. **Form Loading**: Submit buttons show loading state during form submissions
5. **Infinite Scroll Loading**: Loading indicators appear during feed pagination
6. **Error Recovery**: Retry buttons work correctly after failed operations
7. **Reduced Motion**: Animations respect user accessibility preferences
8. **Performance**: Animations maintain 60fps and don't cause layout shifts

### Success Criteria
- All 8 acceptance criteria validated through automated tests
- Loading indicators appear within 200ms of user interactions
- Smooth 60fps animations across all supported browsers
- Error states provide clear feedback with functional retry mechanisms
- ARIA labels and accessibility features work with screen readers
- No performance degradation during loading state transitions
- Reduced motion preferences respected for accessibility compliance
