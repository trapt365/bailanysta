## Problem Statement

**Business Problem:** Need to validate social networking concept with minimal resource investment

**User Problem:** Existing social networks are complex - users need simple, focused social interaction

**Technical Constraint:** Must be built in 2-3 hours with immediate demo capability

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core MVP Features (Priority 1)
1. **Post Publishing** - Text-based content creation
2. **Reaction System** - Single-click feedback (‚ù§Ô∏è)
3. **Commenting** - Basic text responses to posts

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (instant setup)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (rapid prototyping)
- **Data Storage:** JSON file (zero configuration)
- **State Management:** React useState (simplicity)

### Enhanced Concepts (Optional)
- **Ghost Mode Social:** Anonymous 24-hour posts for authentic expression
- **Mood-First Posting:** Emotion-driven content organization

---

## Scope Definition

### IN SCOPE ‚úÖ
- Core 3-function MVP (post/react/comment)
- Responsive web interface
- Instant user feedback
- Demo-ready functionality
- Component reusability architecture

### OUT OF SCOPE ‚ùå
- User authentication system
- Real-time updates
- Database integration
- Multi-user management
- Advanced reactions
- Content moderation

---

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Hour 1)
- React + Vite setup
- Basic component structure
- JSON data handling
- Core UI layout

### Phase 2: Core Features (Hour 2)  
- Post creation functionality
- Reaction system implementation
- Comment functionality
- Component integration

### Phase 3: Polish & Demo (Hour 3)
- Demo content setup
- User experience optimization
- Final testing
- Deployment preparation

---

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK üî¥
- **Time Constraint:** 3-hour limit may require scope reduction
- **Mitigation:** Pre-defined fallback scope (posts + reactions only)

### MEDIUM RISK üü°
- **Technical Complexity:** Component architecture planning
- **Mitigation:** Use proven patterns, avoid custom solutions

### LOW RISK üü¢
- **User Experience:** Simple interaction model reduces confusion risk

---

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Success
- [ ] User can create and publish posts

- [ ] Demo can run in browser

### Optimal Success  
- [ ] All 3 core functions working
- [ ] Polished user interface
- [ ] Instant feedback on all interactions
- [ ] 30-second user validation complete
- [ ] Production-ready deployment

---

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- **Time:** 2-3 hours focused development
- **Skills:** React, CSS, JSON handling
- **Tools:** Node.js, code editor, browser

### No External Dependencies
- **Database:** Not required (JSON storage)
- **Authentication:** Not required (single-user demo)
- **APIs:** Not required (local functionality)

---

## Delivery Expectations

### Technical Deliverables
